            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Furniture is considered to be the game-changer in leading furniture industry. Carefully-chosen raw material, environment-friendly business practice and customer-centric approach is what made furniture a beloved brand at home and abroad.</p>

            <h1>An Overview of the Furniture (ফার্নিচার) Industry in Bangladeshh</h1>
            <p>The domestic furniture market is worth more than BDT 67 Billion (EU Technical Report). With this increasing demand for furniture in cities all over the country, there are hundreds of local stores and furniture brands competing for the consumers. <br /> Currently in Bangladesh furniture (ফার্নিচার) is made from wood, processed wood, melamine board, MDF etc. Although traditionally Bangalis have always favoured the solid wood and beautifully decorated furniture but in the age of millenials people are looking towards more simple and elegantly designed furnitures for their homes. <br /> And Hatil has delivered on that very successfully. Being the only FSC certified furniture manufacturers in Bangladesh, Hatil uses environment friendly raw materials that cause minimal waste. Lean manufacturing is done here to produce diverse products with minimal waste of materials, resources, processing, and human involvement.</p>
