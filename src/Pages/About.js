              <h5>Design with intention</h5>
              <p>
              There's just one way for us to create and that is with intention. Behind the design of our pieces there's an extensive process in which we combine what inspires us with what is needed, and look for a way to make it unique and functional. We don't want to just add a new product to our collection, the idea is that each piece would transmit our values, beliefs, and the love and care that's behind them improving any environment they're introduced to This is what gives value to what we do and pushes us to continue to improve daily.

          <h3>An Overview of the Furniture Industry in the world</h3>
          <p>
            The domestic furniture market is worth more than BDT 67 Billion (EU
            Technical Report). With this increasing demand for furniture in cities
            all over the country, there are hundreds of local stores and furniture
            brands competing for the consumers. <br /> Currently in this world
            furniture is made from wood, processed wood, melamine
            board, MDF etc. Although traditionally old patterns have always favoured
            the solid wood and beautifully decorated furniture but in the age of
            millenials people are looking towards more simple and elegantly
            designed furnitures for their homes. <br /> And Furniture has
            delivered on that very successfully. Being the only FSC certified
            furniture manufacturers in this market, Furniture uses environment
            friendly raw materials that cause minimal waste. Lean manufacturing is
            done here to produce diverse products with minimal waste of materials,
            resources, processing, and human involvement.
